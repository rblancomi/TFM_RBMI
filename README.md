The following diagram indicates the workflow to perform the analysis, including data collection and preprocessing (yellow), downstream analysis (green) and data analysis (red). All the necessary code is stored in this repository, except the scripts used to generated CPTAC and CCLE preprocessed tables.

* [Requirements](#requirements)
* [Data collection and preprocessing](#data-collection-and-preprocessing)
* [Downstream analysis](#downstream-analysis)
* [Data analysis](#data-analysis)

## Repository structure

The repository has the following directories:
* `data`: contains any necessary data that cannot be generated with the scripts in `scripts` folder, except CPTAC and CCLE preprocessed tables. Also, contains manually edited data from external sources to adjust format to input requirements of some functions. Manually curated alignments for ELM-Manual PWMs generation are stored in `elm_manual/alignments/curated` in FASTA format and PNGs in `elm_manual/alignments/curated_pngs`. 
* `scripts`: contains all the scripts needed to reproduce the analysis. Divided in:
    * `data_collection_prepro`: scripts to run data collection and preprocessing (yellow in the workflow diagram).
    * `downstream_analysis`: scripts to run downstream analysis, including generation of Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), *de novo* degron identification and mutation annotation (green in the workflow diagram).
    * `data_analysis`: scripts to run data analysis (red in the workflow diagram).
    * `external`: scripts from external sources.
    * `Utils`: general util functions for the analysis. 

## Requirements

All the analysis was performed using conda in an environment with the dependencies in `environment.yml`. To install the same environment execute:
```
conda env create -n degrons -f environment.yml
```

## Data collection and preprocessing

### 1. UbiNet 

#### 1.1. Position Probability Matrices (PPMs)
>ubinet_PWMs.ipynb

#### 1.2. UbiNet presumed degrons
>ubinet_degrons.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to collect the presumed degrons used by UbiNet to generate the PPMs motifs (used only in the last part of the UbiNet PWMs validation).

### 2. ELM-Manual database

#### 2.1. Database generation
>create_elm_manual_database.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to generate the ELM-Manual database of experimentally validated degrons.

#### 2.2. Database preprocessing
>prepro_elm_manual_database.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to preprocess ELM-Manual database and generate the true degron sets.

### 3. Human proteome of Ensembl 92 canonical transcripts
>ensembl_proteome.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to preprocess the downloaded human proteome of Ensembl 92 canonical transcripts.

### 4. Last exons of Ensembl 92 canonical transcripts
>ensembl_last_exons.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to preprocess the downloaded exons of Ensembl 92 canonical transcripts and extract every gene's last exon.

### 5. Annotate Ensembl transcript stable ID (ENST) in CCLE and CPTAC datasets
>stabch_annotate_enst.py

Python script to annotate every mutation or WT form with the ENST of the canonical transcript.

### 6. Annotate cancer type in CCLE dataset
>add_ctype_to_CCLE.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to annotate the cancer type to each sample.

## Downstream analysis

### 1. Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) degron motifs

#### 1.1. PWMs from UbiNet degron motifs
>ubinet_PWMs.ipynb

The second part of this Jupyter notebook contains the code to transform the PPMs into PWMs.

#### 1.2. PWMs from ELM-Manual degron motifs
>elm_manual_PWMs.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to align degron sequences per motif and transform curated alignments into PWMs.
Also generates intermediate PPMs. 

### 2. PWM scan

#### 2.1. Scan
>motifs_scan_proteome.py

Python script to scan a set of proteins (*e.g.*: proteome) with a PWM using a sliding window technique.

#### 2.2. True degrons scan
>motifs_separate_substrates.py

Python script to divide the `motifs_scan_proteome.py` output in true degrons and the rest of proteins.

### 3. UbiNet PWMs validation
>ubinet_PWMs_validation.ipynb

Jupyter notebook with the code to evaluate UbiNet PWMs with ELM-Manual degrons. 

### 4. PWM quality analysis (positivity threshold, information content, specificity and discovery activity)
>motifs_quality_analysis.py

was executed in paralell for all CPTAC cancer types and CCLE using [qmap](https://github.com/bbglab/qmap)
with template file `stabch_annotate_new_instances.qmap`. 

>stabch_create_pancancer.py
